The Hypothesis mediates bidirectional exchange between three processor engines: Data Processor, System I (Intuition), and System II (Analytical). System I and II engage in Reflection (bidirectional evaluation). This cycle may iterate 2-4 times.",
    "decisionPoint": "At Reflection, the preference is either: (1) CRYSTALLIZED → proceeds to Finalized Preference, (2) NEEDS REVISION → loops back to Data Processor, or (3) NEEDS MORE INFO → proceeds to Information Seeking which returns new data to Input.",
    "patientSpecific": "Unlike clinician decision-making, patient processing is heavily influenced by values, social identity, emotional states, and health literacy. The output is a preference rather than a clinical action plan."
