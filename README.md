An evidence-based framework for modeling clinical environments through Clinical Competency Space (5C) and AI Cognitive Engagement (3A), creating an 8-dimensional Clinical Intelligence space for comprehensive healthcare AI evaluation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Clinical Competency Cube (5C)**: Multidimensional space with 803,626,656 unique clinical scenario cells (1,918 conditions × 7 care phases × 12 care settings × 58 care tasks × 86 care provider roles)
- **AI Cognitive Engagement Cube (3A)**: 3-dimension framework capturing how AI engages with clinical workflows (Agent Facing × Anchoring Layer × Assigned Authority)
- **Clinical Intelligence Space**: 5C × 3A = 8-dimensional space (803.6M clinical scenarios × 63 AI engagement patterns = 50.6B unique cells)
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Explore both cubes through our [GitHub Pages website](https://sdamirsa.github.io/Clinical-World-Model)
- **Standardized Condition Classification**: ICD-10-CM major category codes (3-character) for comprehensive disease coverage
- **Standardized Data Models**: Pydantic-based JSON format for all components
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Multi-level organization supporting different analysis depths

## 🏥 Clinical Competency Dimensions

### 1. **Condition** (1,918 codes, 26 ICD-10-CM chapters)
Medical conditions using ICD-10-CM 3-character codes (complete coverage):
- Comprehensive coverage across all disease chapters (A-Z)
- Standardized clinical terminology (1,918 3-character codes across 26 chapters)
- ICD-10-CM clinical modification used worldwide for medical coding
- Explicit condition-specific capabilities rather than assumed generalization
- Hierarchical organization from chapters to major category codes
- Covers all disease categories: infectious, neoplasms, circulatory, respiratory, endocrine, mental health, and more

### 2. **Care Phase** (7 phases)
Temporal dimension of illness representing the patient journey:
- **Seven Phases**:
  1. At-Risk Identification
  2. Pre-Symptomatic Detection
  3. Diagnostic Workup
  4. Treatment Planning
  5. Post-Treatment Care
  6. Longitudinal Follow-Up
  7. Coping Support
- Patients may occupy multiple positions simultaneously
- Integrated with care settings across patient journey
- Maps to clinical milestones: Health → Pathologic Process → Illness → Diagnosis → Treatment → Follow-up → Cure/Disability/Death

### 3. **Care Setting** (12 settings)
Location of care delivery intrinsically linked to care phase:
- Community screening, home-based care, outpatient clinics
- Emergency departments, inpatient wards, intensive care units
- Operating rooms, rehabilitation facilities, telemedicine
- Alternative framework: SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety)
- Integrated with care phase for comprehensive patient journey mapping

### 4. **Care Task** (58 competencies, 8 domains)
Cognitive tasks that intelligent systems aim to augment or automate:
- **Framework**: Physician Competency Reference Set (Englander et al.)
- **Eight Domains**: Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, Interpersonal and Communication Skills, Professionalism, Systems-Based Practice, Interprofessional Collaboration, Personal and Professional Development
- **Alternative**: MedHELM framework (121 medical tasks, 5 categories)
- Anchored in actual cognitive work physicians perform
- Principled decisions about automation vs. augmentation

### 5. **Care Provider Role** (86 roles, WHO classification)
Healthcare professional role capturing expertise level:
- **Framework**: WHO International Classification of Health Workers (based on ISCO-08)
- **Total Roles**: 86 (51 major categories + 35 specialized subcategories)
- **Five Broad Groupings**:
  1. Health professionals (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, etc.)
  2. Health associate professionals (nursing associates, medical assistants, etc.)
  3. Personal care workers in health services
  4. Health management and support personnel
  5. Other health service providers
- Identifies whose work the intelligent system aims to support
- Includes specialist medical practitioners across 35 medical specialties

## 🧠 AI Cognitive Engagement Dimensions (3A)

### 1. **Agent Facing** (3 options)
Defines whose cognition AI engages:
- **Provider-Facing**: Healthcare provider perspective (CDM model)
- **Patient-Facing**: Patient perspective (PDM model)
- **Encounter-Facing**: System-level interaction perspective (CDM + PDM)

### 2. **Anchoring Layer** (7 layers)
Specifies the point in cognitive architecture where AI intervenes:
- **Input**: Data entry and acquisition
- **Data Processor**: Information processing and transformation
- **Hypothesis**: Differential diagnosis and hypothesis generation
- **System I**: Intuitive, pattern-recognition reasoning
- **System II**: Analytical, deliberative reasoning
- **Reflection**: Metacognitive evaluation and learning
- **Action**: Decision execution and implementation

### 3. **Assigned Authority** (3 levels)
Specifies the degree of AI cognitive takeover:
- **Monitoring**: AI observes and flags issues for human review (Observer role)
- **Augmentation**: AI provides supportive recommendations while human retains decision authority (Supportive contributor)
- **Automation**: AI executes decisions autonomously with human oversight for exceptions (Primary processor)

## 💡 Use Cases

### Healthcare AI Evaluation
Create comprehensive test scenarios using the Clinical Intelligence space:
```python
# Example: Emergency medicine scenario in Clinical Competency Cube
clinical_competency = {
    "condition": "cardiovascular/acute-myocardial-infarction",
    "care_phase": "diagnostic-workup",
    "care_setting": "emergency-department",
    "competency_domain": "clinical-decision-support",
    "provider_role": "emergency-physician"
}
# Clinical Competency Cube: 98 × 7 × 12 × 58 × 86 = 41,061,216 scenarios

# Example: AI engagement specification in Cognitive Engagement Cube
cognitive_engagement = {
    "agent": "clinician",
    "reasoning_layer": "hypothesis",
    "integration_mode": "augment",
    "temporality": "concurrent"
}
# Cognitive Engagement Cube: 3 × 7 × 3 × 3 = 189 engagement scenarios

# Clinical Intelligence = Clinical Competency × Cognitive Engagement
# Total distinct capability claims requiring evaluation
